# Cognitive Health & Brain Impact Features

## Overview

The AI Usage Tracker now includes comprehensive cognitive health monitoring and brain impact analysis to help you understand how AI usage affects your brain and maintain optimal cognitive function.

## New Features

### 1. 👤 User Profile System

**Location**: Cognitive Health tab → User Profile section

**Features**:
- Create and manage your user profile
- Set your age for age-specific insights
- Age groups: Adolescent (<18), Young Adult (18-30), Adult (30-50), Senior (50+)

**Why it matters**: Age significantly impacts how AI usage affects cognitive health. Younger users (especially <18) and older users (50+) have different risk profiles.

### 2. 🧠 Cognitive Health Dashboard

**Location**: Cognitive Health tab

**Metrics Tracked**:
- **Brain Activity Score** (0-100): Measures overall cognitive engagement
- **Memory Usage Score** (0-100): Tracks memory formation and retention
- **Critical Thinking Score** (0-100): Assesses independent problem-solving ability
- **Creativity Score** (0-100): Monitors creative thinking capacity
- **Cognitive Load Score** (0-100): Measures AI dependency level

**How it works**:
- Automatically calculates scores based on your AI usage
- Higher AI usage = Lower cognitive scores (more dependency)
- Scores update daily based on usage patterns
- Visual charts show 7-day trends

**Score Interpretation**:
- 80-100: Excellent - Healthy cognitive engagement
- 60-79: Good - Moderate AI usage
- 40-59: Fair - High AI dependency
- 0-39: Needs Attention - Excessive AI reliance

### 3. ⚠️ Brain Impact Analysis

**Location**: Brain Impact tab

**Features**:
- **Impact Level**: Low, Medium, or High based on usage and age
- **Age-Specific Risk Assessment**: Different thresholds for different age groups
- **Risk Factors**: Identifies potential cognitive issues
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Actionable steps to reduce impact

**Age-Specific Thresholds**:
- **<18 years**: 2+ hours/day = High risk (critical for brain development)
- **18-30 years**: 4+ hours/day = High risk
- **30-50 years**: 3+ hours/day = High risk
- **50+ years**: 2+ hours/day = High risk (higher cognitive decline risk)

**Risk Factors Identified**:
- Excessive AI dependency
- Reduced problem-solving skills
- Memory formation decline
- Critical thinking reduction
- Age-specific developmental concerns

### 4. 💪 Brain-Boosting Task Suggestions

## Understanding the Metrics

### How Scores Are Calculated

**Formula**: `Score = 100 - (AI_Hours × Multiplier)`

- **Brain Activity**: Multiplier = 10 (1 hour = -10 points)
- **Memory Usage**: Multiplier = 8 (1 hour = -8 points)
- **Critical Thinking**: Multiplier = 12 (1 hour = -12 points)
- **Creativity**: Multiplier = 10 (1 hour = -10 points)
- **Cognitive Load**: Multiplier = 15 (1 hour = +15 points)

### Impact Level Calculation

Based on:
1. **Daily Average Hours**: Total hours ÷ days in period
2. **Age Group**: Different thresholds per age
3. **Usage Patterns**: Consistency and intensity

## Recommendations

### For Low Impact (0-1 hour/day)
- ✅ Maintain current balance
- ✅ Continue independent thinking
- ✅ Use AI as a tool, not a crutch

### For Medium Impact (1-2 hours/day)
- ⚠️ Set daily limits
- ⚠️ Practice tasks manually first
- ⚠️ Engage in brain exercises daily

### For High Impact (2+ hours/day)
- 🚨 Reduce AI usage immediately
- 🚨 Prioritize manual problem-solving
- 🚨 Daily brain-boosting activities required
- 🚨 Consider cognitive health consultation if persistent

## Age-Specific Guidance

### Children & Adolescents (<18)
- **Critical**: Brain still developing
- **Risk**: AI dependency can impact neural development
- **Action**: Limit to 1 hour/day, prioritize learning fundamentals

### Young Adults (18-30)
- **Focus**: Building cognitive skills
- **Risk**: Over-reliance can weaken problem-solving
- **Action**: Balance AI use with independent thinking

### Adults (30-50)
- **Focus**: Maintaining cognitive function
- **Risk**: Gradual cognitive decline acceleration
- **Action**: Regular brain exercises essential

### Seniors (50+)
- **Focus**: Cognitive maintenance
- **Risk**: Higher vulnerability to cognitive decline
- **Action**: Limit AI use, prioritize mental exercises

## Best Practices

1. **Set Daily Limits**: Use AI intentionally, not habitually
2. **Try First, Then AI**: Attempt tasks manually before using AI
3. **Daily Brain Exercises**: Complete at least one suggested task daily
4. **Monitor Trends**: Check cognitive health scores weekly
5. **Balance**: Use AI as enhancement, not replacement for thinking
